# Agentic RAG Chabot

Agentic RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) Chatbot is an AI system designed to offer a new level of interactivity and assistance by combining real-time information retrieval with advanced language generation. This approach allows the chatbot to not only provide pre-determined responses but also to dynamically generate new content or autonomously pull up-to-date information as needed to enhance the accuracy and relevance of generated responses, making it an effective tool in varied applications such as the AI Art Assistant for Ben Uri Gallery and Museum.

## 1. App Overview
[Back to ToC](#toc)

This section introduces the application of Agentic RAG Chatbot as the AI Art Assistant, specifically tailored for Ben Uri Gallery and Museum. Users can interact with the assistant to explore a rich database focused on Jewish, Refugee, and Immigrant contributions to British visual culture. The assistant is designed to enhance user engagement and provide educational insights through interactive discussions about art and artists.

## 2. How It Works
[Back to ToC](#toc)

The AI Art Assistant utilizes a combination of retrieval-augmented generation technology and a curated knowledge base about the artists and artworks featured at Ben Uri Gallery and Museum. When a question is asked, the system decides whether to pull information directly from the knowledge base or to generate a contextual response that synthesizes information into a coherent and informative answer. This process includes:
1. **User Query Handling**: Receive and parse user queries.
2. **Information Retrieval**: Fetch relevant data or past inquiries from the knowledge base.
3. **Response Generation**: Use LLMs to craft responses that are informative, factually accurate, and engaging.
