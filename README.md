# Agentic RAG Chabot

Agentic RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) Chatbot is an AI system that injects intelligence and autonomy into the traditional chatbot framework by combining three key elements: real-time information retrieval, advanced language generation, and an agentic approach. When a user poses a question or needs information, the chatbot autonomously determines whether to retrieve relevant data from a knowledge base or generate a response based on its existing knowledge. The "agentic" aspect means the chatbot actively identifies the necessary information, seeks it out, and integrates it into its answers to enhance the accuracy and relevance of generated responses.
